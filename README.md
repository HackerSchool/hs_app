# HSApp
## Description
This is the official HackerSchool's application, made with Flutter for a better cross-platform experience and connected to the HSInventory to get better access to it and manage/request new items from the app.
Besides that, the app also notifies the user for new events, tells which projects are currently being made and show who are the nucleus' members with their skills, contact information, which projects they are developing and more!
This is currently in working progress and it's open for anyone in the nucleus to develope/enhance it!
Check the section *How to contribute to the project?* down below.

## Setup the project
To start developing the project, the Flutter framework should be installed in the system and run the command

```bash
flutter create .
```

After being cloned.
This assures that any dependency is updated and creates/updates the folders `Android` and `iOS` to enable their build.

After that, any project's code can be seen in the usual `./lib` folder.

## How to contribute to the project?
Since this project was in development by an initial group that already left the nucleus, its current state is in still maintenance, which means that there is no new feature to be added and any contribution for now is to fix/improve what there is still in there and enabling the growing this project for a future iterations.
Therefore, a way to contribute to this project is to see the Issues tab of this repository, select one of them and then create the respective Pull Request and Branch to develope that same issue.

After all the commits and modifications had been made, you should request a revision from the owner or the team of the project (for now, it's an owner and he is @filipe-varela or MaxxVilp#5243 on discord).
After that, if everything is alright, the commit is launched to the `main` branch.

Besides that, every implementation should have, when possible, an unit test to verify that it works. 
If there is no unit test when needed or if the PR doesn't work as expected, the latter is sent back to be improve or fixed.
Additionally, there will be added a Continuos Integration workflow in the repository to ensure that everything is working as expected and the unit tests are running well and without any problems.

### Contribution besides programming
It's very welcomed any contribution to the project that it isn't intended for developing, that is, to help in documentation or making this README or the issues better to read or well written.

Besides that, any contribution for testing the application with a real device is very well welcomed as well!
And, if possible, an issue may be created to fix any problem that occur in the using of the application.

## Final words
As mentioned previously, this project was left behind by the team and since then, no one was in charge of moving this project forward. 


Therefore and for now, the goal of this project is it to be more independent of whoever is developing it, making an emphasis on the issues being well written and having a more documentation of the current state of the app.
This implies that the rate of new progress made throughout the time may be uncertain and may end up in a stall state once more.
But, an effort will be made to avoid this to happen again so soon, but nothing is promised until there is more helping or more labour into this project.
